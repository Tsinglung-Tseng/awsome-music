>One day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away."
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
"When you get older. Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die. <p align="right">—— The Days by Avicii</p>
